# Maneuver - Advanced FRC Scouting Application

A comprehensive, mobile-first scouting application for FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) teams. Maneuver provides powerful tools for match scouting, team analysis, pit scouting, alliance selection, and data management.


## 🚀 Features


- **Comprehensive Data Collection**: Track autonomous, teleop, and endgame performance with real-time input
- **Interactive Field Maps**: Visual interfaces for starting positions and strategy
- **2025 Game Support**: Coral scoring (4 levels), algae management, climb analysis
- **Match Strategy Integration**: Import match data from The Blue Alliance API and Nexus
- **Field Canvas**: Draw and annotate match strategies, auto-fill by match number

- **Multi-Tab Dashboard**: Detailed performance metrics across Overall, Auto, Teleop, and Endgame phases
- **Advanced Analytics**: Strategy overview with filtering, sorting, charts, and multiple aggregation types
- **Team Comparisons**: Side-by-side analysis with visual indicators and statistical significance
- **Position Analysis**: Field maps showing starting position preferences and success rates
- **Alliance Selection**: Drag-and-drop pick lists, desktop/mobile layouts, alliance initializer, and selection tables


### 🏆 Scouter Profiles & Achievements
- **Persistent Scouter Profiles**: Stake tracking, prediction scoring, and achievement system
- **Achievements**: Unlockable badges and progress tracking for scouters

### 🏗️ Pit Scouting & Assignments
- **Full Pit Scouting UI**: Forms for robot specs, photos, auto/teleop/endgame, technical notes
- **Pit Assignment Tools**: Assignment controls, event configuration, pit map visualization, spatial clustering

### 📱 Data Management & Transfer
- **Flexible Transfer**: JSON files and fountain codes for large datasets
- **Local Storage**: Persistent data with merge/overwrite capabilities (IndexedDB via Dexie)

### 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite (dev server + build)
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui primitives
- **Local DB**: Dexie (IndexedDB) — `src/lib/dexieDB.ts` is authoritative
- **Data Transfer**: Luby Transform fountain codes (QR), JSON import/export
- **PWA**: vite-plugin-pwa with service worker runtime caching
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics 4 (lightweight wrapper at `src/lib/analytics`)



## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (preferred) or yarn

## 📖 Usage

### Quick Start

1. **Demo Data**: Click "Load Demo Data" on homepage to explore all features
2. **Core Workflows**: Match scouting → Team analysis → Strategy planning → Alliance selection
3. **Data Transfer**: Use QR codes or JSON files to share data between devices

### Key Workflows

**Match Scouting**: Game Start → Auto Phase → Teleop → Endgame → Submit

**Team Analysis**: Select team → View multi-tab statistics → Compare with others → Analyze positions
**Strategy Planning**: Dashboard overview → Interactive charts → Column configuration → Event filtering

**Alliance Selection**: Create pick lists → Research teams → Drag-and-drop ordering → Export/share
**Pit Scouting**: Assign scouters → Fill out pit forms → Visualize pit map → Export pit data
**Achievements**: Track scouter progress, unlock badges, and view leaderboard

## 🔧 Architecture & Developer Notes

- **Database is authoritative**: Most app state and exports/imports flow through `src/lib/dexieDB.ts` (`db`, `pitDB`, `gameDB`).
